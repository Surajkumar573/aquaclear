    <h1><strong>ðŸ’¡ F. A. Q. ðŸ’¡</strong></h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <br>
    <p> The project aims to improve the water utilization in households as in preventing excess use of Reverse Osmosis(RO) and water softening machines when not required (depending on the quality of water). Also, the project aims to prevent highly contaminated water from enter the house water-storage.</p>

    <h2>What are the hardware components used?</h2>

    <br>
    <p><center>1. Arduino Uno <br>
      2. TDS sensor<br>
      3. DS18B20 temperature sensor<br>
      4. HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor<br>
      5. 5V Relay<br>
      6. 5V submersible water pump<br>
      </center>
    </p>

    <h2>What is the contribution of this project towards society?</h2>

    <br>
    <p>This IOT based water quality monitoring system will make people more aware about
their surroundings. Such projects are specially helpful for households who receive erratic and contaminated water supply (areas such as South Delhi, Ghaziabad etc.) . Consumption of bad quality water by people can pose a big health risk such as water-borne diseases like cholera. 

Areas having scarce water supply such as Rajasthan can also take advantage of this system, seeing water wasted by RO would definitely pain them. Universities can also take use of the system in their campuses.</p>

    <h2>What parameters are being measured through this project?</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Through this project, the various water quality parameters that are being measured by us are Temperature and TDS. Data is being
    collected through various sensors like TDS sensor and Temperature sensor.
  </p>
    <br>

    <h2>How is it different from others?</h2>

    <br>
    <p>The project is different from others in the sense:<br>
      1. It aims at minimizing water wastage during purification process of RO.<br>
      2. Trying to keep water storage systems clean by preventing contaminated water entering the system.<br>
      3. Although independent technologies exist for such use cases, systems that combine all these functionalities in one place are not prevalent in the marketplace.<br>
      4. The contribution of this system for the benefit of households and societies can be huge if implemented nicely because the system saves both water and energy resources.</p>
