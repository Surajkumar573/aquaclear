# Aquaclear
It aims to improve the water management and conservation in households as in preventing excessive use of Reverse Osmosis(RO) when not required. Also, the project aims to prevent highly contaminated water from enter the house water-storage.

# Functionalities
1. Check the water quality (TDS) of supplied water, if contamination exceeds safe limit then alert user immediately about the bad water quality so that the user can take a suitable decision whether to continue to keep filling the tank (in case of no water reserves left) or stop the motor.

2. A Reverse Osmosis (RO) purifier wastes a lot of water while purification, in situations where water quality is good enough for a less powerful water filter (which doesn't waste water while purification) we can filter water using it instead of the RO. Also, by doing this, water retains its mineral content whereas purified RO water has no minerals.

# Hardware Used
